This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) v3 site and then BabylonJS was added.
For TypeScript
```bash
npx create-react-app babylonjs-app --typescript
```

BabylonJS was added using 'react-babylonjs'
```bash
yarn add react-babylonjs
yarn add react-reconciler
yarn add @babylonjs/core
yarn add @babylonjs/gui
yarn add @babylonjs/loaders
```

All of the code for the site is in `/src/App.tsx`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` / `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
